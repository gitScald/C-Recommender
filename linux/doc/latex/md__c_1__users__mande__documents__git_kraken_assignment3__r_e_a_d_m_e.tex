\subsection*{Important\+: MS Windows}

If you want to run the project in Windows (be it in Visual Studio or Eclipse), you will have to do one of the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Comment out function {\ttfamily main()} in {\ttfamily gindexer.\+cpp}, or
\item Comment out function {\ttfamily main()} in {\ttfamily googler.\+cpp}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Because Windows I\+D\+Es don\textquotesingle{}t allow the creation of multiple executables within the same project, and because it\textquotesingle{}s a pain to link another project with one, let alone two different I\+D\+Es, I\textquotesingle{}ve opted to allow to swap between two {\ttfamily main()} programs by commenting the other one out.

\subsection*{Linux}

When testing the program under Linux, use the file structure located in the {\ttfamily linux/} folder, navigate to the root folder, and call {\ttfamily make}. Then, to run either executable, call the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily googler/exe/googler}, or
\item {\ttfamily indexer/exe/indexer}
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you need to rebuild the project, call {\ttfamily make clean} in the root directory, followed by another {\ttfamily make}.
