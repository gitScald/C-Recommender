 C++ Movie Recommender
 =====================

This is a C++11 implementation of a movie recommendation system.

Compilation:
------------

Navigate to the root directory and call:
    make

If needed, make a clean install by calling:
    make clean
    make

Usage:
------

Upon successful compilation, navigate to the following subdirectories to test the program of interest:
    googler/exe
    indexing/exe
    summarizer/exe
    recommender/exe

NOTE: Both 'googler' and 'indexing' programs will search for the 'files/' directory, in which should be located 'index.txt' (which holds the paths of all documents to reference), 'extra_doc.txt' (an extra document to index after an initial normalization), and 'stopwords.txt' (optional). The 'summarizer' program uses data provided in the 'a3data/' directory, and the `recommender` program uses a `MovieSummaries` directory (provided by the professor).

NOTE: Failure to provide any of the indexing text files will cause a WARNING, but not a RUN-TIME ERROR. This means the index will display an empty table, and query operations will likely fail.

The application was developed with the following:

Operating system:   Microsoft Windows 7 64-bit SP1 6.1.7.7601
IDE:                Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition 15.3.1
Compilers:          Microsoft Visual C++ 14.10.25008
                    G++ 6.3.0 (MinGW port for Windows)
                    G++ 4.9.2 (ENCS Linux environment)
